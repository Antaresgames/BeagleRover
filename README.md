BeagleRover
===========

This is an implemention of a semi-intelligent rover for a BeagleBone.
The intelligence of the system comes from an interface to a GPS sensor,
a digital compass, and a USB WiFi adapter for communication with a base
station.

This project includes software for interfacing with the GPS, compass, and
the motors of an RC car. Python scripts are also included to communicate
with the RC car over the network, giving it commands to turn and go forward
as well as query the GPS and compass sensors.
